Abstract
A major feature of meiosis is the classical phenomenon of crossover interference, a one-dimensional patterning process that produces evenly spaced crossovers along each chromosome.  Here, quantitative analysis of diagnostic molecules along budding yeast chromosomes reveals that interference has broader effects than previously understood.  This process sets up not one, but two interdigitated patterns of related periodicities (~450nm and ~900nm).  Furthermore, both patterns comprise spatially clustered assemblies of crossover recombination, chromosomes axis and synaptonemal complex proteins ("triads").  ~450nm periodicity triads are sites of canonical crossovers and manifest as focal accumulations of triad components.  ~900nm periodicity triads are sites of a minority type of crossover and manifest as domainal accumulations of triad components.  Together, the two tiers of triads account for all crossovers in wild type meiosis.  Interestingly, the levels of triad components are dynamically modulated by the conserved protein remodeler Pch2/TRIP13 throughout pachytene.
